# Digital-Twin-of-a-Traffic-Scene-Using-RSU-and-AWSIM
B. Sc. Thesis concerning the semi-automatic creation of a digital twin of a traffic scene near Amirkabir University of Technology

Project Proposal Accepted at 5/11/2023

## Note  
**Still waiting for Professor Javanmardi's approval on when to upload the source code. For now I'll be uploading the project runtimes.**   
[Checkout my other repository where I'm writing the simulation code for AWSIM.](https://github.com/rzninvo/AWSIM)

## **(LATEST UPDATE)** The real time simulation (Semi Digital Twin) for an intersection demo:

## Project Progress and Timechart:
* **Step 1** : Getting Lidar input data from our Computer Engineering faculty as a demo and attempting to create it's 3D model.   
DONE!

* **Step 2** : Finishing the Robotics Course and learning ROS.   
DONE!

* **Step 3** : Setting up AWSIM and it's required libraries.   
DONE!   

* **Step 4** : Learning ROS2 Humble and the architecture behind Autoware and AWSIM.  
DONE!

* **Step 5**  : Learning PCL and converting pcap recordings to PointCloud2 ROS2 Topics and publishing it.  
DONE!

* **Step 6** : Implementing the real-time 3D detection and tracking using CenterPoint.  
DONE!

* **Step 7** : Learning Unity  
DONE!

* **Step 8** : [Added the `autoware_auto_perception_msgs` to the Ros2ForUnity Plugin in AWSIM.](https://github.com/rzninvo/AWSIM/commit/aeeadf17f201f0bec529d97b834286d8ddc114c2)  
DONE!

* **Step 9** : Creating a new sample scene in which any Tracked Object in Autoware with the confidence of 70+, Spawns a Vehicle.
DONE!

* **Step 10** : Making a SLAM map based on the recorded pcap file and creating a Lanelet2 Map using the Tier4 website.
